# Investment Calculator
Investment calculator with GUI

Hi and welcome to my investment calculator! It is programmed in Python and makes use of the libraries [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib), [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy),
[tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and [PyQt5](https://github.com/PyQt5). So make sure you have these installed in order to run the program!

# Get started
To run the program, just download the folder and unzip it. Open the .py file in any IDE of your choice and make sure all imports are recognised by your Python interpreter. 

# Functionalities
Running the program opens a small window. The user can specify the investment by filing out all fields:
